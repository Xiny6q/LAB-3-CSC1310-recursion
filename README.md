LAB 3 / CSC1310 recursion
what should this program do? (specifications)
You will implement 5 recursive problems described below and call them from a main function to demonstrate them working. If you write the functions non-recursively, then you will get no credit for those functions. All recursive functions could be written non-recursively, but the purpose of this lab is to learn recursion.

PROBLEM 1: Sum of numbers
Write a function that accepts an integer argument and returns the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number passed as an argument. For example, if 50 is passed as an argument, the function will return the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, … 50. Use recursion to calculate the sum.

problem 2: isMember array function
Write a recursive Boolean function named isMember. The function should accept three arguments: an array, a value, and the size. The function should return true if the value is found in the array, or false if the value is not found in the array.


PROBLEM 3: String Reverser
Write a recursive function that accepts a string object and the length of the string as its argument and prints the string in reverse order.

PROBLEM 4: PALINDROME DETECTOR
A palindrome is any word, phrase, or sentence that reads the same forward and backward. Here are some well-known palindromes:

KAYAK

RACECAR

ROTOR

LEVEL

MADAM

MOM

NOON

The main function will take the user’s string and make it all uppercase and also remove all spaces and commas. Then, you should write a bool function that uses recursion to determine if the modified user’s string argument is a palindrome. The function should return true if the argument reads the same forward and backward

Problem 5: Recursive Multiplication
Write a recursive function that accepts two arguments into the parameters x and y. The function should return the value of x times y. Remember multiplication can be performed as repeated addition:

7 * 4 = 4+4+4+4+4+4+4

Main Function
This function is written for you except for the function calls!!!

What to turn in
Please put Lab3.cpp in a zipped folder and upload to ilearn submission folder.
